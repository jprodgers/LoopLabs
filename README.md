# LoopLabs
LoopLabs is a modular looping station created at the 2019 Formlabs hackathon.

Currently things are pretty bare bones, as this is a hackathon project, but the goal is to create something much more robust and fuller featured longer term. At the moment there is a usbMidi controller built from a teensy 3.2. The schematic is in the kiCAD directory. The python only records 4 basic loops at the moment, but it works.
